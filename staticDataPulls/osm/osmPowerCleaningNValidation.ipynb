    "    - power=tower\n",
    "    - power=transformer\n",
    "    - power=substation\n",

    "4. Lines shouldn't intersect without a node. May form false intersection.\n",

    "5. Substations can probably be collapsed to points?\n",

    "6. Voltage should match connected lines/equipment.\n",
    "    - Must have transformer present to change voltage, e.g., between a line (230kv) and substation (33kv)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Hierarchy\n",
    "    - Transmission lines should connect substation -> substations\n",
    "    - Distribution feeders should connect substations -> poles (which we will later take onto end users)\n",

    "8. Missing attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Required connections are present\n",
    "    - e.g., transformers should link two diff voltage levels\n",
    "    - Towers/poles not linked to any lines\n",
    "    - there are certainly other required connections to check here\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Plausibility\n",
    "    - Lines that cross 100km with no supporting towers or poles\n",
    "    - Substations or generators far outside built-up/electrified areas may be mis-tagged\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Isolated subnetworks\n",
    "    - Some may be microgrids, most are probably not\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Tag all features as osm original (\"osm\"), osm modified (such as adding attributes), or created here\n"
